# Cal Pal
Cal Pal is a voice controlled application which uses a pretrained Speech to Text model to convert audio into text which is then preprocessed, parsed, and the commands contained therein are executed.

## Example
The following is example of an exchange that can occur while using the application:
```
User: My name is John
Cal Pal: Hello John

User: I will eat fish
Cal Pal: What is the energy value of fish?

User: 80 times 4
Cal Pal: Adding fish at 320

User: I am going to eat fish
Cal Pal: Same fish as last time?

User: Yes
Cal Pal: Ok, adding fish at 320

User: Undo
Cal Pal: Ok, removing last entry

User: What is my total for today?
Cal Pal: Your total for today is 320 energy units 
```
